 DBMS      

1) Stores data in a structured manner, but it may not necessarily use tables or enforce relationships between tables.
2)Focuses on managing and storing data but may not enforce strict integrity constraints, such as foreign keys and unique constraints.
3)Handles data independently, and relationships between tables may not be explicitly defined or enforced.
4) Generally more suitable for smaller-scale applications where data complexity and relationships are not as critical.
5) Offers flexibility in terms of data storage and retrieval, but it may lack features like data validation, transactions, and complex querying.


 RDBMS 

1)Organizes data in tables with rows and columns, and enforces relationships between these tables. It provides a more structured and organized way to store and retrieve data.
2)Enforces data integrity rules to ensure that relationships between tables are maintained, and it typically supports ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation,    Durability).
3)Emphasizes relationships between tables. It uses keys (primary and foreign) to establish and maintain connections between related data in different tables.
4)Scales well for larger and more complex datasets. Its structured approach and support for normalization contribute to better scalability.
5)Provides a more rigid structure, but this rigidity ensures data consistency, integrity, and supports complex querying and transactions.
